# NES Dev Template Project

This is a sample project to start a NES homebrew project using cc65 and neslib in C. The idea is that you could copy this folder, run `make run` and have an emulator launch with a freshly built .nes file based off the files in this folder. For now, this is going to be based on Linux since that is my main OS, but I am open to adding additional OS support if requested.
